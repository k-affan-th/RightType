//! Low-level keyboard hook (`WH_KEYBOARD_LL`) — Windows only.
//!
//! This is the whole input→correct pipeline, run **synchronously on the hook
//! thread**. Keys pass through normally while we accumulate the current word; in
//! Auto mode a boundary that completes a wrong-layout word is **swallowed** and we
//! inject `backspaces + correction + boundary` in one atomic batch. Doing it
//! synchronously and swallowing the trigger makes the replacement race-free: the
//! mistyped letters are already in the target app before we inject, and because
//! every keystroke is serialised through this one thread, nothing can interleave —
//! even under fast typing. (An earlier async-worker design raced and garbled.)
//!
//! Modifier state (Shift/Ctrl/Alt/Caps) is read live from `GetAsyncKeyState` /
//! `GetKeyState` rather than tracked from the event stream. Tracking it ourselves
//! let a modifier *stick* whenever a key-up was missed — e.g. the Alt+Shift used to
//! switch keyboard layout — which then captured every following letter as if Shift
//! were held. Reading the real key state each time makes sticking impossible.
//!
//! The work here is tiny (a `ToUnicodeEx` call + two hashed dictionary lookups +
//! a small `SendInput`), so the callback stays far under the `LowLevelHooksTimeout`
//! that evicts slow hooks — see `docs/PLAN.md`, Bug 1. We also ignore our own
//! injected events (tagged in `dwExtraInfo`, plus `LLKHF_INJECTED`) so a
//! correction can never feed back into itself.
